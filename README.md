## Numeric Methods Implemented in Python

This README lists six numeric methods implemented in Python within this repository:

1. **Gauss-Seidel Method**: An iterative method used to solve a system of linear equations.
   - Implementation: `Gauss_seidel.py`

2. **Gauss Elimination Method**: A method used to solve systems of linear equations by transforming the system's augmented matrix into row-echelon form.
   - Implementation: `Gauss.py`

3. **Gauss-Jordan Method**: A variation of the Gauss elimination method, which transforms the augmented matrix into reduced row-echelon form.
   - Implementation: `GaussJordan.py`

4. **Bisection Method**: A numerical method for finding roots of continuous functions.
   - Implementation: `bisection.py`

5. **Jacobi Method**: An iterative algorithm for solving linear systems, particularly when the matrix is diagonally dominant.
   - Implementation: `jacobi.py`

6. **Newton-Raphson Method**: Used to find successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.
   - Implementation: `nraphson.py`

These methods provide efficient solutions to various numerical problems and are coded in Python.
